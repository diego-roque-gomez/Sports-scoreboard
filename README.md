# Sports scoreboard
Development of a functional prototype for a sports scoreboard

This project was developed in collaboration with the sports department at Tecnológico de Monterrey and focused on the construction of an electronic scoreboard for the university's American football stadium.

## Requirements ##
- High visibility under outdoor lighting conditions
- Weather-resistant structure
- Secure mounting in the stadium cabin
- Remote control capability

## System overview ##
A functional prototype was designed, manufactured and submitted to the campus sports director for evaluation.

The system implemented an IoT-based architecture in which an ESP32 microcontroller received wireless commands from a web interface, enabling remote control of the scoreboard.

## Technical Contributions ##
- Design of a customised circuit board with multiple 7-segment displays and 8x8 LED matrices
- Implementation of MAX7219 drivers for efficient display control and GPIO optimisation
- Hardware integration with ESP32
- Collaboration on the design of a retractable mechanical mechanism for deployment and environmental protection

## Mechanical design
The mechanical structure was developed collaboratively through iterative design cycles.

Individual components were modeled separately and later integrated into a unified assembly. The team continuously refined structural supports, mounting brackets, enclosure elements, and deployment mechanisms to ensure stability, weather resistance, and safe installation in the stadium cabin.
